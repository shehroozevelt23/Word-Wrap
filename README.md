# Word-Wrap
This C++ program takes input from standard input and outputs then in such a way such that the width of the output is no greater than the width provided (as a command line argument). If no width is supplied, the default width is 25.
A second optional argument is also accepted, either -l, -r, or -c, which is "left justify", "right justify", & "center respectively". If the second argument is not provided, it does left justification by default.
